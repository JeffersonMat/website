      ParagraphOne:
        "I hit the ground running as soon as my feet touched NZ soil three years ago. I quickly adapted to a new culture and worked my way up from a front-of-house role at a winery to a retail store manager at a craft brewery (all within my second language—no biggie).",
      ParagraphTwo:
        "Working in customer service exposed me to a kaleidoscope of critical situations. Being empathetic meant I could face these situations head-on, with an innate understanding that we all come from different backgrounds and experiences.",
      ParagraphThree:
        "I have a deep love of teaching. My experience as a volunteer home English tutor with former refugees has not only strengthened my English, but my teaching skills as well. In the context of coding, I love learning from and teaching others, always with a view of strengthening a team’s capabilities.",
